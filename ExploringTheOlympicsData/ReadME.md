## Exploring 120 years of Olympics Data

An innocent discussion around intra-mural sports with some friends at University turned into a grand debate about sporting prowess and we decided to turn it into a Python project! We decided to do some number crunching on 120 years of olympics to see which are the best performing countries at the olympics and what makes them great! <br>

### What I learnt
Apart from helping satiate my hunger for the truth, this project helped me learn a lot of new cool Python skills - <br>

* Renaming and dropping columns
* Merging data frames together 
* Reshaping dataframes using melt and pivot tables
* Lambda functions in Python
* List comprehension
* Groupby operations
* Stacked bar charts, line charts, overlaying line charts on bar charts
* Linear regression using Python
* KNN classifier

Hope this motivates you to perform data analyses on a dataset of your choosing.
